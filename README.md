## TransCode
TransCode is an online tool that utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3 language model to facilitate the conversion of code between different programming languages. With TransCode, you can easily transform your code from one programming language to another, making it a versatile and convenient code translator.

## Aim
TransCode streamlines the process of converting code between different programming languages, making it an efficient tool for developers who need to work with codebases in various languages or want to explore alternative implementations. It leverages the power of GPT-3 to ensure accurate and reliable translations, enabling programmers to save time and effort in manual code conversion tasks.

## Usage
The usage of the code translator tool, TransCode, involves six simple steps:
1) Select Input Programming Language: In the first step, you need to choose the programming language in which your original code is written. This is done by selecting the appropriate option from the dropdown menu provided by TransCode.
2) Enter or Paste Code: After selecting the input language, you can either write your code directly into the first editor or paste it from an existing source.
3) Choose Output Programming Language: The next step is to specify the programming language to which you want your code to be translated. Again, you can make this selection from the dropdown menu in TransCode.
4) Click "Translate": Once you have set the input and output languages and entered your code, you click the "Translate" button. TransCode will then utilize OpenAI's GPT-3 language model to perform the conversion.
5) View Translated Code: The translated version of your code will appear in the second editor on the screen. This editor will display the code in the output programming language you selected.
6) Copy Translated Code: If you are satisfied with the translated code, you have the option to copy it to your clipboard using the provided copy icon. This allows you to easily paste the converted code into your desired project or environment.
